README for SgtPepperKSU VPN build of Tomato Firmware

In order to compile, please start with a Tomato Firware source tree.  Then simply run:
bunzip2 < patch_file.patch.bz2 | patch -p1
substituting 'patch_file.patch.bz2' with the file name of the compressed patch file provided.  That's it! You're ready to compile.
If you plan to redistribute, be sure to read the COPYING file.

To have your VPN start automatically when the router is rebooted, add "service vpnserver1 start" (no quotes, replacing server with
client and 2 for 1 if appropriate) to your init script.  You will probably also need to add a delay before it with "sleep 10" (you
can test to see if a shorter or longer delay is needed).

The have the router periodically check if the VPN is running and restart it if it has stopped, add the following to your init
script (replacing server, 1, */30, or sleep 10 as appropriate):
## Start VPN init script
#Generate vpnup.sh
echo "#!/bin/sh
killall -0 vpn\$1 2> /dev/null
if [ \$? != 0 ]
then
logger \"\$0: Starting vpn\$1\"
service vpn\$1 start
else
logger \"\$0: vpn\$1 already running: \$(pidof vpn\$1)\"
fi
" > /tmp/vpnup.sh
# Make vpnup.sh executable
chmod +x /tmp/vpnup.sh
# Schedule vpnup.sh to run every 30 minutes
cru a CheckVPNServer "*/30 * * * * /tmp/vpnup.sh server1"
# Wait 10 seconds and run vpnup.sh once
sleep 10
/tmp/vpnup.sh server1
## End VPN init script
