README for SgtPepperKSU VPN build of Tomato Firmware

The sources are available in the git repository at http://repo.or.cz/w/tomato.git
If you plan to redistribute, be sure to read the COPYING file.

To have the router periodically check if the VPN is running and restart it if it has stopped, also add the following to your init script (replacing vpnserver1 or */30 as appropriate):
# Schedule vpnup.sh to run every 30 minutes
cru a CheckVPNServer "*/30 * * * * service vpnserver1 start"

If you have any questions/comments/concerns, contact me at tomatovpn@keithmoyer.com

Enjoy!
