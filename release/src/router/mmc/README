I'll add more information here at some point in the future.

If you want to build the sources outside of buildrootng, use Makefile.standalone
Rename to Makefile and adjust paths to compiler and libraries within the distribution.

If building within buildrootng, create the "packages/broadcom-mmc" directory and
copy in "Makefile.buildrootng" as Makefile.

Then run "make menuconfig". You should see an mmc module available under 
"Kernel Modules--->Other Modules".

Select it to be built as a module, and save your configuration.

Then run 'make'.
